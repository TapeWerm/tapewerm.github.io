            I am a senior undergraduate student at Portland State University
            majoring in Computer Science. I use Bash, C, C++, Git, Linux,
            Systemd, Vim, VS Code, and more. My PSU CAT username is vverm, my
            first name's initial plus my last name's first 4 letters, which
            looks like werm. Werm was taken on GitHub so TapeWerm it was. It
            seems kinda edgy now but I don't want to break any links over it.
